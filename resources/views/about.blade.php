      <h2>Team</h2>
      <p>We have a team backed by skilled, experienced, responsible and well educated Merchandisers and Managers to
        look after our company&apos;s merchandise and quality control. A lot of effort goes into planning and
        selecting material of the highest quality that suits the style of the garments. Take for example the choice of
        selecting the best possible fabric for a Denim Pant. Even though a number of light-weight textiles, and
        fabrics are available making an exclusive choice for that perfect apparel is the challenge. We make sure that
        the material we use is organic such that it qualifies as a trademark offering of Fine Fair garments.</p>

      <h3>Quality</h3>
      <p>PK Apparel puts quality as the first priority which is why every manufactured product is inspected before
        being dispatched for distribution. Intricate details like the stitching of buttons and size of button holes
        are given proper inspection. Rivets, metal buttons and the snaps are checked for durability and their ability
        to withstand with rust. If we find any problem while inspection we send the defaulted piece immediately back
        for re-sewing. After resolving the issue, the jeans are again passed through the inspection phase. This
        process is repeated until the issue is resolved.</p>
